# cookie-clicker-autobuy
I made this because I wanted to make my own thing without modding the game. There are mods that probably do it better, such as [this one](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823633161), although I have not tested any myself. 

### Basic Controls
- `I` -> Information
- `X` -> Close program

## Functionality

When the mouse is moved to click something, it will return to a set "home" point, so if the autoclicker is running, it will still work at the same time (or so you don't lose your cursor). That point is set by default to where your big cookie probably is, but you can change it with:
- `H` -> Set home location

### Autobuy Buildings
Will buy any purchaseable building. Make sure to set points such that they form a square surrounding all buildings that you want to be considered for purchase. Do not scroll after setting points.
- `V` -> Set buy corner 1
- `N` -> Set buy corner 2
- `B` -> Toggle buying

##### How?
Looks for white pixels on the screen within the region set.

### Autoclick
Clicks the mouse repeatedly. This can be used for clicking the cookie or buying upgrades.
- `A` -> Toggle clicking
- `S` -> Set delay

### Click Golden Cookies
Finds and pops golden cookies. 
- `G` -> Toggle golden cookie popping

##### Notes
Not extensively tested.
