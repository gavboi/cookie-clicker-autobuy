# cookie-clicker-autobuy
I made this because I wanted to make my own thing without modding the game. There are mods that probably do it better, such as [this one](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823633161), although I have not tested any myself. 

### Basic Controls
- `I` -> Information
- `X` -> Close program

## Functionality

### Autobuy Buildings
Will buy any purchaseable building. Make sure to set points such that they form a square surrounding all buildings that you want to be considered for purchase. Do not scroll.
- `V` -> Set corner 1
- `N` -> Set corner 2
- `B` -> Toggle buying

##### How?
Looks for white pixels on the screen within the region set.

### Autoclick
Clicks the mouse repeatedly. This can be used for clicking the cookie or buying upgrades.
- `A` -> Toggle clicking
- `S` -> Set delay
